# PathFindingAlgorithm

**ToDO List**

Pathfinding algorithm plays a vital role in games that are used by AI agents in finding a good path 
from the starting point to the goal avoiding obstacles with minimum cost.

Implementation of path finding algorithms.
- [x] Astar
- [x] Dijkstra

* A Star is used to find the path to the known position so it always consumes less time to find the path compared to Dijkstra
* Dijkstra algorithm is used to the shortest path to the unknown position. Even though it finds the shortest path, it consumes 
  more time and resources.
